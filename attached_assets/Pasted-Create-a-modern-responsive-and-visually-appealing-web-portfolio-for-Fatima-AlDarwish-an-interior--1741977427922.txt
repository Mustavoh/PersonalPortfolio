Create a modern, responsive, and visually appealing web portfolio for Fatima AlDarwish, an interior designer. The portfolio should showcase her expertise, projects, and personality while being easy to navigate. Follow these guidelines:

Design and Layout:

Use a clean, minimalistic design with a professional color palette (e.g., neutral tones with accents of gold or pastel colors).

Include the following sections:

Home: A hero section with her name, a tagline (e.g., 'Transforming Spaces with Elegance and Innovation'), and a high-quality background image or video.

About: A brief bio highlighting her experience, design philosophy, and achievements.

Portfolio: A gallery of her best projects with high-resolution images, project titles, and short descriptions. Use a grid or masonry layout.

Services: A list of services she offers (e.g., residential design, commercial design, 3D rendering, etc.).

Testimonials: Quotes from clients or collaborators.

Contact: A contact form, email address, phone number, and links to her social media profiles (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.).

Functionality:

Make the website fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Include smooth scrolling and subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins, hover effects) to enhance user experience.

Ensure the website is accessible (e.g., alt text for images, keyboard navigation, and high contrast).

Technical Requirements:

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a framework like React if preferred).

Place the src folder in the root directory to ensure the project is deployable on any hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages). Do not nest the program inside a client folder.

Include a README.md file with instructions for deployment.

Optimize images and assets for fast loading times.

Additional Features:

Add a dark mode toggle for user preference.

Include a downloadable PDF version of her resume or portfolio.

Integrate a simple blog section where she can share design tips or project updates (optional).

Deployment Readiness:

Ensure all paths are relative and the project is structured to be easily deployable.

Include a .gitignore file and any necessary configuration files (e.g., package.json if using Node.js).

Personalization:

Use placeholder text and images where necessary, but ensure the design is tailored to an interior designer's portfolio.

Add her name, 'Fatima AlDarwish,' prominently throughout the website.

Provide the complete code and file structure in a zip file or shareable format, ready for deployment.
